\section{Proposed method}
To overcome the problem, we have chosen Python as programming language with Keras \parencite{web:AboutKeras} being main NN library in use. Since we need computation power, Google Colab \parencite{web:AboutGoogleColab} is being used as development platform. With that in mind, we can split the project into 11 main subsections.
