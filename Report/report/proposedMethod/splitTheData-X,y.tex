\subsection{Split the data - X, y}
Now that we have the dataframe encoded we can split it up to X (features) and y (target). In the code block bellow, we can see X is collection of attributes from encoded dataframe that are indexed 1 and above. Opposite to that, y is single attribute from encoded dataframe that has index 0.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Split the data - X and y]
X = encoded_dataframe.iloc[:,1:len(encoded_dataframe.columns)]
y = encoded_dataframe.iloc[:,0:1]
\end{lstlisting}
