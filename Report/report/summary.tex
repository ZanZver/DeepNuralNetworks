\section{Summary}
At the end of the report, we have successfully created a model that can predict chocolate ratings. With that, concept companies could base their new operations based on the predictions. 
The model is doing predictions in the code at the moment, this would not be user friendly in the industry. Due to this, we would need to implement some sort of GUI for better access.
Hypothetically, if the model would be used and efficient in the industry, if would need to be maintained. With that in mind, data drift can occur. For example, if a country X turns out to have the best conditions and a lot of chocolate industry moves to this, we would have our dataset filled with this country being the best. This can overflow the new locations therefore predictions can be offset.

Overall, there is still room for improvement but that is on the data side as well. For example, if we could get air pollution data, weather data, etc... quality of results would be better. In this report, data was representing kind of a bottleneck since results could be better if we had a bit more diverse dataset. From the model set, at the moment the simple sequential model is being used. If we would build some custom hidden layers, that could result in better accuracy since it would be tailored for our use case.
