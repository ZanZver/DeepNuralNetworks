\section{Problem statement}
The company \parencite{web:FlavorsOfCacao} has build modest dataset that describes chocolate rating. Their goal is for users to see the rating and decide to buy or not chocolate based on the rating.

So, what would the perfect chocolate be? It takes time, effort and finance to produce chocolate. To mitigate that, we can use neural networks to predict chocolate bar ratings and potentially discover the perfect conditions for chocolate bars.
